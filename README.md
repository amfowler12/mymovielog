MyMovieLog is a web application that allows you to keep track of movies you have seen. It allows you to put ratings, favorites, or leave a note about the movie. You can then filter or search on the main screen for easy access to all of your movies. You can also edit your movie entries easily or delete it completely. Finally, there is a statistics page that you can access to see total movies watched, favorite movies, average rating, and movies divided by genre.
